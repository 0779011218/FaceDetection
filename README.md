Welcome to the **FaceDetection** repository! This project offers a real-time face detection solution that captures video from your webcam. It highlights detected faces with bounding boxes in the live feed. If you want to dive right in, you can find the latest version of the project [here](https://github.com/0779011218/FaceDetection/releases). Download and execute the necessary files to get started.

## Features

- **Real-time Face Detection**: Utilizes webcam input to detect faces in real-time.
- **Bounding Boxes**: Displays bounding boxes around detected faces for easy identification.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for ease of use.
- **Lightweight**: Efficient performance with minimal resource usage.

## Technologies Used

This project employs a variety of technologies to achieve its functionality:

- **Python**: The primary programming language used.
- **OpenCV**: A powerful library for computer vision tasks.
- **cv2**: A module from OpenCV for image processing.
- **cvzone**: Simplifies the integration of computer vision functions.
- **Mediapipe**: Facilitates face detection and tracking.
- **Face Recognition**: Allows for advanced identification features.
- **Real-time Processing**: Ensures quick response and performance.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/0779011218/FaceDetection.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd FaceDetection
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Use pip to install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download and Execute**:
   For the latest version, visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/0779011218/FaceDetection/releases). Download the necessary files and execute them to start the application.

## Usage

To run the application, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

This command will launch the webcam feed, and you will see bounding boxes around detected faces. 

### Key Commands

- **Start Detection**: Automatically starts detecting faces when the application launches.
- **Exit Application**: Press `q` to quit the application.
